Welcome to the email messaging program. In this code you will see me simulating an Email Messaging system with the following objectives:

A message has a recipient, a sender, and a message text. A mailbox can store messages. Supply a number of mailboxes for different users and a user interface for users to log in, send messages to other users, read their own messages, and log out.
